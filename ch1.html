                    <li><b>First Generation Computer:</b><br>Computers built from aproxamitly 1950 to 1957 were called the first genersation computers. Computers such as UNIVAC I and the IBM 701 </li>
                    <li><b>Second Generation Computer:</b><br>From roughly around 1957 to 1965, major changes to size and complexity of computers making them more reliable. At this time computers were made availble primarly for business owners, colleges, and government agencies.</li>
                    <li><b>Third Generation Computer:</b><br>This generation lasted from around 1965 to 1975. This began with the integratd circuit era and was also the birth of the sofaware industry. Here is when the first minicomputer was created.</li>
                    <li><b>Fourth Generation Computer:</b><br>Lasting from 1975 to 1985 was the fourth generation of computers. This was also the first appreance of the microcomputer. A complete computer system could now be contained on a single circuit board. This era also began the first appearence of computer networks. </li>
                    <li><b>Fifth Generation Computer:</b><br>Fifth generation is from 1985 till today. Ultra-large-scale integrated circutis, supercmoputers and parallel processer. This was also the start of laptops, smartpohnes and tablets and much of the technology you see today.  </li>

                    <li>What was it used for?<br>One of its biggest strengths is its strong support for large precision fixed-point demical calculations. It was orginally used by the DOD as a stopgap measure.</li>
                    <li>Is COBOL still being used today? If so, what for?<br>Yes, today it is still used by government and private sector orginizations to run financial, adminstrative and buiness applications. According to IBM, COBOL handles 95 percent of all ATM transactions. </li>
