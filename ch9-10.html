                <p>A: In the textboom it refers to it because it suggest that computer languages would be much simpler if computer programs were written in the same language or "superlanguage". But s</p>
                <b>Q: Why isn't there just one computer programming language?</b><br>
                <p>A: Each prorgramming language was designed different to meet the specific needs of one particular area of an application.</p>

                    Or to add color: background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.4);</p>
                <b>Q: What should a stack overflow question title do?</b><br>
                <p>A: The question should be clear and to the point. Also, be sure to include key words or errors and summarize the specific problem. </p>
                <b>Q: What are the steps to writing good stack overflow question?</b><br>
                <p>A: Search your question first to ensure it hasn't already been answered. Then write a title that clearly summarizes the specific problem. Introduce the problem
                     before entering any code. Be sure to include relevenet tags and proofread before posting. Lastly, respond to feedback after posting.
