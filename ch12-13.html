                    <li><i>Physcial Realization</i>: the system is not constructed from entities that can be represented by physical objects.</li>
                    <li><i>Safety</i>: experimenting on a replica can be safer then on the actaul system. </li>
                    <li><i>Speed of construction</i>: it might take too much time to construct a physical model and can sometimes be faster to design and build a computer simulation.</li>
                    <li><i>Time Scale</i>: some physical systems change too slowly or too quickly. </li>
                    <li><i>Ethical behavior</i>: some physical models have serious moral and ethical consequences, perhaps the best known being the use of animals in medical research.</li>
                    <li><i>Ease of modification</i>: if unsatisfied with a physical model, then a new one would need to be constucted. In a simulation, only need to change some numerical parameters and rerun the existing model.</li>

                    <li>What is Illustris?</li>
                    <p>Illustris is a supercomputer simulation designed to model the evolution of the cosmos by 13.8 billion years. From the Big Bank up until today.</p>

                    <li>What fields of science were involved in the Illustris computational model?</li>
                    <p>The Illustris computational model involved the folling fields of science:

                    <p>The galactic eveolution</p>

                    <li>How long did the project take?</li>
                    <p>The project took five years, with the software teams made up of the United States, France, and Germany. It required 3 months of nonstop parallel computing.</p>

                    <li>How many years of gallactic evolution are simulated in Illustris?</li>
                    <p>14 Billion Years.</p>

                    <li>Illustris was created using two supercomputers. What is a supercomputer?</li>
                    <p>It is a computer with a high level of performance, capable fo performing billions of calcuations per second by using thousands of processor to work together on complex problems.</p>
